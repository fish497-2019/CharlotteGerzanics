# GerzanicsProject
Charlotte Gerzanics: R project repository
In this project I work with data on algal blooms, often written as HABs (Harmful Algal Blooms).
In this project I created graphs to look at how salinity and sample depth affected cell count numbers. 
I am using the Habsos data for all of my plots and figures 
The Gaeta CLC data was used to practice commands but was not used in this repository. 
The origional, unmodified data is called HAB_data. 
The mutated dataset is called HAB_data muted. 
All data sets are stored in the "data" subdirectory. 
All images, including plots I made in r and a map provided by the researcher, are in the "plots" subdirectory.
A breif slide presentation, including graphs, images and bullet points, is included in the "slidepresentation" subdirectory.
My code is commented and seperated into groups based on purpose. These groups are seperated by #-----title-----. 
For example, all code for my plots is under #----plots----. 
At the very bottom, beneath #---these gave me errors----, I have included code that did not work. It is included for reproducability purposes and in case I (or someone else) wants to create a map with the lat and long. This way they don't have to start from scratch.
